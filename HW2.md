GOOGLE WEAR: MOTO 360

1) What kind of data is this device collecting? What sensors are used? Where is the data being stored and who has ownership over the data? Is the data available to the user, and if so, in what format? 

The device collects location data on the user in order to show the weather and accurate time, but this is based on the phone it’s connected to. The device collects base movement data such as speed and motion to count footsteps. It also tracks the user’s heart rate using “photoplethysmography” - basically, flashing a green LED and determining heartbeat based on the reflection of light against veins.
The data is stored on Google’s servers - it’s a Google device running Android. Google owns the data, but viewing it is available for the user (though not in a real raw format, as Google Home or Android phone data, but instead by checking the watch, which graphically assembles the data).

2) How far can you trace the path of the data? How far can you trace the physical development of the device, its materials and manufacture? This will take some investigative research:

The Moto 360 smartwatch is manufactured by Motorola, which does most of its manufacturing in China and, as of 2015, some of it in India. There used to be a Motorola factory in Fort Worth, which manufactured phones, but it only operated from 2013 to 2014 and it seems unlikely that it manufactured the smartwatches. Motorola also manufactures hardware in Brazil, but it seems like China is almost certainly the source of manufacturing this smartwatch.

3) My project

My project is a conceptual protoype of an Android wear notification. When I used to wear the watch, I found myself checking the smallest notifications incessantly. The watch produces a false sense of futurism, importance, and self. In order to challenge these ideas - that a human should always be "on call" whether to work or friends, I plan on creating a set of Android Wear notifications of minimizing statements: "YOUR TIME IS NOT IN HIGH DEMAND," "YOU ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO THE UNIVERSE," etc, as well as real-time, visceral notifications of exactly where you are since the watch/your phone track that. While these seem morbid, they can actually be read as liberating, and even feminist; they imply a lack of obligation to the infinite capitalist call for labor, be it physical or emotional.
